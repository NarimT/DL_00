    "# Geospatial Environment Installation Guide - PyGILE Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of software development, package managers have become a fundamental tool for simplifying the installation of software packages and their dependencies. They automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages in a consistent manner. In the field of geospatial data science, where several packages need to be installed, package managers ensure a smooth and efficient setup of your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through setting up the PyGILE (Python for Geographic Information and Location-based Environmental analysis) environment using Miniforge and mamba for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Download and Install Miniforge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Miniforge\n",
    "Visit the official Miniforge download page: [https://conda-forge.org/download/](https://conda-forge.org/download/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the appropriate installer for your operating system. For Windows, select the Windows installer (highlighted in the orange box).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Miniforge\n",
    "Run the downloaded installer and follow these important installation options:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Installation Options:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Check**: \"Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable\" (Optional but recommended)\n",
    "- ✅ **Check**: \"Register Miniforge3 as my default Python 3.10\"\n",
    "- ✅ **Check**: \"Create start menu shortcuts (supported packages only)\"\n",
    "- ✅ **Check**: \"Clear the package cache upon completion\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Click **Install** to proceed with the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Download PyGILE Environment Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone or Download the Repository\n",
    "Download the PyGILE repository from GitHub: [hhttps://github.com/Geoinformatics-Lab/PyGILE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Downloads\\pyGILE-main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare the Installation Script\n",
    "Navigate to the following directory:\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Downloads\\pyGILE-main\\environments\\windows\\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find a file named `windows_install_pygile_base.txt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Rename this file to `windows_install_pygile_base.bat` and change the file type to \"All files\" when saving. This converts the text file to a Windows batch file that can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Open Miniforge Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for \"Miniforge Prompt\" in the Windows Start menu and open it. You should see a command prompt similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]>mamba activate C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\miniforge3\n",
    "(base) C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Navigate and Install PyGILE Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigate to the Installation Directory\n",
    "Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the batch file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "cd C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\Downloads\\pyGILE-main\\environments\\windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run the Installation Script\n",
    "Execute the batch file to install the PyGILE environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "windows_install_pygile_base.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be patient!** The installation process will take several minutes. Monitor the progress by checking the log files that will be created:\n",
    "- `pygile_installation.log` - Shows installation progress\n",
    "- `pygile_errors.log` - Shows any errors encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation will display progress information such as:\n",
    "- Searching for conda installation\n",
    "- Cleaning conda cache\n",
    "- Creating pygile_base environment with Python 3.10\n",
    "- Installing NumPy, core geospatial libraries, and other packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Activate the PyGILE Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "After successful installation, you'll see a success message. Now activate the newly created environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Using Conda\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "conda activate pygile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Using Mamba (Recommended)\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "mamba activate pygile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Don't be confused - mamba and conda are essentially the same thing, but mamba is faster for package management operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correctly activated environment will show `(pygile)` at the beginning of your prompt:\n",
    "```console\n",
    "(pygile) C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Set Up Jupyter Lab Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install and Register IPython Kernel\n",
    "To make your environment available in Jupyter Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "conda install ipykernel\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name pygile --display-name \"Python (pygile)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigate Back to Main Directory\n",
    "```console\n",
    "cd ..\\..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes you back to the main PyGILE directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch Jupyter Lab\n",
    "```console\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait 10-15 seconds for Jupyter Lab to start. A browser window will open showing the Jupyter Lab interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Select the Correct Kernel\n",
    "In the Jupyter Lab launcher, look for and click on \"Python (pygile)\" under the Notebook section. This ensures you're using the correct environment with all the geospatial packages installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installed Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyGILE environment includes essential tools for geospatial data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Tools:**\n",
    "- Python 3.10 with compatibility settings\n",
    "- GeoPandas for vector data analysis\n",
    "- Rasterio for raster data processing\n",
    "- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy for data science\n",
    "- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization\n",
    "- Jupyter Lab for interactive development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geospatial Libraries:**\n",
    "- GDAL/OGR for spatial data I/O\n",
    "- Shapely for geometric operations\n",
    "- Pyproj for coordinate reference systems\n",
    "- Contextily for basemap integration\n",
    "- And many more specialized packages\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regular Usage Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "For daily use of the PyGILE environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Miniforge Prompt**\n",
    "2. **Deactivate base environment** (if active):\n",
    "   ```console\n",
    "   conda deactivate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Activate PyGILE environment**:\n",
    "   ```console\n",
    "   conda activate pygile\n",
    "   # OR use mamba for faster operations\n",
    "   mamba activate pygile\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **Navigate to your project directory**:\n",
    "   ```console\n",
    "   cd path\\to\\your\\project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:\n",
    "   ```console\n",
    "   jupyter lab\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that the packages are installed correctly, open a new notebook in Jupyter Lab using the \"Python (pygile)\" kernel and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import geopandas as gpd\n",
    "import rasterio\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "print(\"All packages imported successfully!\")\n",
    "print(f\"GeoPandas version: {gpd.__version__}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all imports work without errors, your PyGILE environment is ready for geospatial data science work!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If activation fails**: Make sure you're using the correct environment name `pygile`\n",
    "- **If packages are missing**: Check the error logs in the installation directory\n",
    "- **If Jupyter doesn't show the kernel**: Re-run the ipykernel installation command\n",
    "- **For performance**: Use `mamba` instead of `conda` for faster package operations"
