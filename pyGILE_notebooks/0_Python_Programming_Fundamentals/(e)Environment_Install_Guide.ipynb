    "# Geospatial Environment Installation Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of software development, package managers have become a fundamental tool for simplifying the installation of software packages and their dependencies. They automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages in a consistent manner. In the field of geospatial data science, where several packages need to be installed, package managers ensure a smooth and efficient setup of your environment.\n",

    "## Creating and Activating a New Environment\n",
    "Each project or workflow may require different versions of packages or even different packages altogether. To manage these variations, it is best practice to create isolated environments for each project. This prevents conflicts between package versions and ensures that your projects remain reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new environment in `conda` using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda create --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate this environment, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any package you install will be installed in this environment, keeping it isolated from other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Geospatial Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we install the packages, we need to add `conda-forge` to your channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda config --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "conda config --set channel_priority strict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can install `rioxarray` and related geospatial packages using `conda`. For `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda install rioxarray xarray\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, we need to install the following packages: `pyproj`,  `contextily`, `earthpy`, `census`, `geoplot`, `osmnx`, `pykrige`, and `us`.  We will start with the packages available through `conda-forge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda install pyproj geopandas       \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally install those packages that aren't available through `conda-forge`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "pip install census contextily earthpy geoplot osmnx us pykrige\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have all the packages installed and ready to be used in your new environment!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying the Installation\n",
    "Next we need to activate the environment and verify that the packages are installed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "First activate the environment you created earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then enter a python session by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} console\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see `>>>` in your terminal, indicating that you are in a Python interpreter session.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that the packages are installed correctly, you can run the following commands in a Python interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import rioxarray\n",
    "import xarray\n",
    "import pyproj\n",
    "import geopandas\n",
    "import contextily\n",
    "import earthpy\n",
    "import census\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can exit the Python interpreter by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "exit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you encounter any errors during the import, it means that the package is not installed correctly. You can try reinstalling the package or checking for any dependencies that may be missing.\n",
    "```"
