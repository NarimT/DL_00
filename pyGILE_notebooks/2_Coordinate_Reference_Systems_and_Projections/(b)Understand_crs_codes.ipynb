    "As you may recall, a coordinate reference system can either be a geographic coordinate system or a projected coordinate system (also known as a map projection). A geographic coordinate system consists of a datum, which consists of an ellipsoid model and how this ellipsoid is aligned with the geoid. It's spherical in nature, and units are typically angular (latitude and longitude). A projected coordinate system is created by taking a geographic coordinate system and using math to transformg a 3-D surface onto a flat, 2-D surface. Units are typically linear and are oftentimes measured in meters.\n",
