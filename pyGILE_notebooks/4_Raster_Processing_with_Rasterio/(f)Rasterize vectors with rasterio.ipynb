We will also read in a raster file to get the raster's metadata (i.e., coordinate system) so that we can apply those parameters to the vector file. In other words, the raster will serve as a \"reference\" for the the rasterization of the vector. In particular, we are going to match the shape (number of rows and columns) and the transform (UL corner location, cell size etc). For a refresher on transforms, please see the chapter on [Affine Transforms](d_affine.md).\n",
