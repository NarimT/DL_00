    "## Why is Resampling Important?\n",
    "*Before you begin* any analysis using rater data it is critical that you have rasters that are \"co-registered\". Co-registration requires that any two rasters have the same resolution, and orientation - the origins can differ but they much align. *In other words, co-registration requires that cell centroids align perfectly for all intersecting areas.* Resampling is also extremely common during reprojection operations as it often requires changing the orientation, scale or resolution of an image. \n",

    "There are [a number of methods](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.enums.html#rasterio.enums.Resampling) to resample data, but they often take the form of \"nearest neighbor\", \"bilinear\", and \"cubic convolusion\" - these interpolation methods [are explained here in some detail](d_raster_crs_intro_interpolation_options). But there are a number of other including: ['average', 'cubic_spline', 'gauss', 'lanczos', 'max', 'med', 'min', 'mode', 'nearest']. \n",

We will start by simply reading in the data and coersing a higher resolution, by adding more rows and columns. To understand the `transform`, let's review [affine transformations](d_affine).
